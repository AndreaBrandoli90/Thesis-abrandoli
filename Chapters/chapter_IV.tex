\chapter{Cryptographic Background}
\label{chpr:crypto}
The aim of this chapter is to provide all the cryptographic primitives to deeply understand distributed consensus and blockchain immutability in Bitcoin. Furthermore, a cryptographic background accompanies us to the hearth of this work: blockchain notarization.

The more the world becomes digital, the more we need information security. Cryptography mixes advanced mathematical and computer science techniques to provide confidentiality, data integrity, authentication and non-repudiation. In order to build security protocols we must introduce cryptographic primitives.

\section{Hash Functions}
A hash function is a particular mathematical function that maps an arbitrary length input message into a short, fixed-length bit string, usually called \textit{digest} or \textit{hash value}. Hash functions can be seen as a digital fingerprint of a message, i.e. a unique representation of a message.
