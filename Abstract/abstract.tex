\chapter{Abstract}
Notarization of digital documents is traditionally achieved by a trusted certification authority, which represents a single point of failure. An application built upon a distributed system reaching consensus in a decentralized way can greatly strengthen the notarization process. In particular the Bitcoin blockchain, the most reliable decentralized system, can be used as notary in a procedure called timestamping, to prove that a digital document existed prior to a certain time $t$ and in a certain state. In this work, we explain the timestamping process and \textit{OpenTimestamps}, an open and scalable timestamping standard. Our aim has also been to develop a fully operating timestamping service, that we have realized while marginally improving and extending \textit{OpenTimestamps} with additional features.
